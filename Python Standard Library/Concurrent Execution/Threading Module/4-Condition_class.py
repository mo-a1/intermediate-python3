"""
The Condition class in the Python threading module provides a way for threads to synchronize their execution based on
 the state of a shared resource. Here are the methods available in the Condition class:

__init__(self, lock=None) - This method initializes a new condition object, with an optional lock object to use for
 synchronization.

acquire(self, *args) - This method acquires the underlying lock associated with the condition variable.

release(self) - This method releases the underlying lock associated with the condition variable.

wait(self, timeout=None) - This method releases the lock associated with the condition variable, and then waits for
 a signal or notification. If a timeout value is specified, the method will wait for the specified amount of time before returning.

notify(self, n=1) - This method wakes up one or more threads that are waiting on the condition variable.
If the n parameter is not specified, the method wakes up one thread. If n is greater than 1, the method wakes up that
 many threads.

notify_all(self) - This method wakes up all threads that are waiting on the condition variable.

__enter__(self) - This method is called when the condition variable is used as a context manager with the with
 statement. It acquires the lock associated with the condition variable.

__exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback) - This method is called when the with statement is exited. It releases
 the lock associated with the condition variable.

wait_for(self, predicate, timeout=None) - This method releases the lock associated with the condition variable,
 and then waits for a signal or notification until the given predicate function returns True. If a timeout value is
  specified, the method will wait for the specified amount of time before returning.

These are the main methods available in the Condition class. The Condition class also inherits the Lock class's locked()
 method and the RLock class's acquire() and release() methods.

In summary, the Condition class provides a way for threads to synchronize their execution based on the state of a shared
 resource. It allows threads to wait for a specific condition to be met before continuing their execution. The Condition
  class is often used in conjunction with a Lock or RLock to synchronize access to a shared resource.
