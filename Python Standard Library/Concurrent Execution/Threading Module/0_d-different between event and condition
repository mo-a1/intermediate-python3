The Event and Condition classes in the Python threading module are both used to coordinate the execution of multiple
 threads. However, they are designed for different purposes and have some important differences. Here are some key
 differences between the Event and Condition classes:

Purpose: The Event class is used to signal that a specific event has occurred, while the Condition class is used to 
 synchronize the execution of multiple threads based on a condition.

Signaling: The Event class provides a simple way to signal that an event has occurred, using the set() method.
 The Condition class provides a more flexible way to signal that a condition has been met, using the notify() and 
 notify_all() methods.

Waiting: The Event class provides a way for threads to wait for an event to occur, using the wait() method.
 The Condition class provides a similar way for threads to wait for a condition to be met, using the wait() method.
 However, the Condition class also provides a way for threads to wait for a timeout, or to wait while checking for
 a specific predicate to be true.

Locking: The Event class does not provide any locking mechanism, while the Condition class requires a lock object to be
 passed to its constructor. This allows the Condition class to be used in more complex synchronization scenarios, 
 where multiple threads may be accessing the same shared data.

In summary, the Event and Condition classes are both useful for coordinating the execution of multiple threads, but they
 have different purposes and are designed for different scenarios. The Event class is simpler and provides a way to
 signal that an event has occurred, while the Condition class is more flexible and provides a way to synchronize
 threads based on a condition. The Condition class also requires a lock object to be passed to its constructor,
 which allows it to be used in more complex synchronization scenarios.
