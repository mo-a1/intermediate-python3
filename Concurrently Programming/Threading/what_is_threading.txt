4- daemon thread:-
    In computer science, a daemon is a process that runs in the background.

    Python threading has a more specific meaning for daemon. A daemon thread will shut down immediately when the program
    exits. One way to think about these definitions is to consider the daemon thread a thread that runs in the
    background without worrying about shutting it down.

    If a program is running Threads that are not daemons, then the program will wait for those threads to complete
    before it terminates. Threads that are daemons, however, are just killed wherever they are when the program is exiting.
